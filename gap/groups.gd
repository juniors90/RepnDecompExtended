#! KernelIntersection(rep,rep) . . returns a basis for the intersection of the kernels of all 
#! module homomorphisms A -> B
#! Created by Peter Webb May 8, 2019. Corrected April 18, 2020.
#! This uses a version of SafeNullspaceMat with two arguments, the second being the field.

#!
#! PrincipalIdempotent(group,prime) returns a vector in the representation space of 
#! RegularRep(group, GF(prime)) that is the block idempotent of the principal block. Thus if b is 
#! this idempotent and e denotes the vector in the regular representation corresponding to the
#! identity elements, the vector b.e is returned. Spinning it gives a basis for the principal block. 
#! This idempotent is constructed using a formula of B. Kulshammer Arch. Math 56 (1991) 313-319.
#! Code written by Peter Webb February 2020.
